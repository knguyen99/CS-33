	a. The program does not print anything because the function pthread_join is not called.
	because pthread_join is not called, the main function continues without waiting for the
	thread to finish, thus the program finishes before anything is printed.

	b. We can fix this bug by changing the exit call on line 10 with a call to pthread_join. 
	By calling pthread_join, the main routine is forced to wait for the current thread to 
	finish before it can continue, thus sleep and "Hello, world!\n" is printed before the 
	program is exits.

	Echo_cnt is safe because the variable mutex. Because of this global variable, 
	mutex protects byte_cnt so that it only calls functions that are safe to call.
	Mutex is a lock to prevent unsafe function calls. It is not reentrant because
	mutex is a global variable, thus all threads running share the same variable.
	Because of this, the function is not reentrant.
