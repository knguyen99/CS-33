From line 2 of the assembly code, we can learn that 4 < B <= 8.
This is because ints take 4 bytes and chars take 1 byte so 
the size of the char array can be between 5 and 8. From line 3, we
learn that 24 < B + A*2 <= 32. This is because shorts are 2 bytes
and longs are 8 bytes. From the last line, we learn 176 < A*B*4 <= 184,
or 44 < A*B <= 46. Since B is between 5 and 8 and A*B is either 45 or 
46, B is 5 and A is 9.

A = 9.
B = 5.
