A. The sizeof operator always returns a value of type size_t,
which is an unsigned data type. Because the value is unsigned,
negative numbers become large positive numbers smaller than
maxbytes. This means that sizeof(val) will always be a positive
number less than or equal to maxbytes and maxbytes-sizeof(val)
will always be greater than or equal to 0.

B. By casting sizeof(val) to an int, sizeof(val) is allowed to be
a negative number since it is signed. Thus, to make the conditional
work, the conditional must be changed to :
        if(maxbytes - (int)sizeof(val) >= 0)
